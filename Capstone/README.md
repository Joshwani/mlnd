# Fitting the LPPLS model to empirical data via Keras and TensorFlow

## Setup

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Running the code
All the code exists in the `project_code.ipynb` file. Once the requirements are installed you should be good to run the model and fit the lppls model to the data using the custom Keras Layer.
